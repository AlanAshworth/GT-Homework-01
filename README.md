# GT-Homework-01-Code Refactor

Refactored code for improved accessibility.

<!-- ![screenshot](./public/02.png) -->

## Description

Tasked with refactoring an existing webpage to make it accessible, extra streps were taken to improve a "client's" codebase for long term sustainability. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

Ensured all links are functioning correctly and cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and
including comments before each element or section of the page.
